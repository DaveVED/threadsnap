## Contribution

ThreadSnap is not just a public-source project but also an open-source one. This means your contributions are more than welcome! Is there a feature you’re missing? A glaring bug you know how to fix? Or are you simply looking for a good first issue on a simpler project? Whatever the case, we’re excited to have you onboard. Here’s how to get involved:

1. _Open or Work on an Issue_: All open-source contributions should revolve around an issue. Whether it’s a new feature request or a bug fix, start by opening an issue. This ensures there’s a clear mapping between your work and the project’s goals. Pull requests without a corresponding open issue will not be accepted.
1. _Open a branch_: Once you’ve got an issue to work on, create a new branch. Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) standards for naming and commits. (No need to fork—you can work directly in the repository for now.)
1. _Submit Pull Request_: When your work is complete and meets the prerequisites above, submit a pull request. Someone from the team will review it and provide feedback or merge it if everything aligns.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We want to ensure all pull requests align with our vision for ThreadSnap. Therefore, it’s critical to open an issue before submitting a pull request and get feedback on your idea. While you’re welcome to start work immediately, pull requests that don’t fit the project’s goals may not be merged.


## Setup Your Development Environment

You can use these steps to set up a working development environment. ThreadSnap is a straightforward project, and you should be up and running quickly.

### Configure / Startup Nix

For the uninitiated, Nix is a tool that lets us configure everything needed for development in a single file. It’s great for consistency—and for sparking Twitter debates about dev setups. We like it, love it, and have set it up to make your environment startup as smooth as possible.

If you don’t have Nix, you can install it [here](https://nixos.org/). Once you have Nix installed, navigate to the root of the project directory and run:

```bash
nix-shell
[nix-shell:~/workspace/github/threadsnap]$
```

This command will initialize the Nix environment, and you’ll be ready to go. It’s that simple!
